        <h1>Driving Principles:</h1>
        <p>Our driving principles for activities are the followings:
        <ul>
            <li>"Be good and do Good" and "Be and Make"</li>
            <li>Uphold Swami Vivekananda's ideal, "Service of mankind is service to God" and use this opportunity for our inner growth</li>
            <li>Express the natural inner urge to stand by the unfortunate poor patients, their families and let them feel that they are not alone</li>
            <li>It is quality rather than quantity, that is the main focus.</li>
            <li>Sevabrata as we see it, is a platform to exercise selfless service and enlightening our own souls as workers.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <!-- <p>Taking up activities in other fields of services may happen based on the situation and agreement of members.
