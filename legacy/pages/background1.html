            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Our unyielding faith on Swamiji's ideals of "Service of mankind is service to God" is the mantra behind our mission. We, therefore, make it a point to practice exactly what we believe in so firmly. We consider “Sevabrata” as a means to reach out selflessly to many desperate & critically ill patients and do our best to provide timely medical help in all matters be it financial, logistical, advisory etc.
            </p>
            <p>Inspired by the enduring legacy of Swami Vivekananda, our mission is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Help provide timely medical advice to poor and needy families in rural and semi-rural India.</li>
                    <li>Help organise funds from our members & broader society to be able to provide the much needed financial assistance to the needy and helpless suffering families.</li>
                    <li>Provide logistical support in terms of transportation and temporary accommodation to patient’s families during the hospitalization.</li>
                    <li>Look after the post-hospitalization financial and wellbeing of the patient.</li>
                    <li>Keep regular touchpoints and connects with the patient families lest should there be any further deterioration in the health condition.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
