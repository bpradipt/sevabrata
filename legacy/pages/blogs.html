            <p>In mid-2014, Sevabrata had received a patient from a village in rural Bengal. His name was Poltu Bera.
                Poltu had been suffering from a critical heart ailment that needed nothing less than heart
                transplantation. For Sevabrata, it was a daunting task. But with the blessings of the Almighty and
                unrelenting of our members on the wee hours of 1st Jan 2015, Poltu went through a successful heart
                transplantation in BGS Global Hospital, Bangalore, under the able guidance of Dr. Anand Subramanium. It
                gives us immense pleasure to let everyone know that we could arrange a fund of fifteen lakhs, which also
                included his rehabilitation and post-operative care. It's been four years since, and Poltu is doing
                fine. He stays in Bangalore now, with his wife and two children.

                some years ago and was advised of a critical heart operation and related treatment. She underwent a
                surgery in a

                family of
                Guddi Devi was monetarily and emotionally supported in all possible ways. However, despite all the
                efforts, Guddi
                Devi succumbed to some post-operative complications.
