                    "Poltu" - the name itself has been an inspiration for many by now including all of us who were
                    engaged
                    in different capacity in this journey for about last 18 to 20 months.
                    It was exactly a year back, on 3rd January 2015 morning, when we all were anxiously waiting for the
                    completion of a very critical, complex and major operation conducted by a group of expert doctors of
                    BGS
                    Global Hospital, Led by Dr. Anand Subramanyan. The successful HEART Transplantation was a life
                    changing
                    event for not only Poltu & his family, but also all of us who took this challenge inspired by the
                    ideology and spirit of Thakur Sri Ramakrishna, Maa Sarada Devi and Swami Vivekananda led by my
                    friend
                    Partha Adhikari.
                    Today we have come across an eventful year, with challenging & critical moments as well as very
                    inspiring, motivating, happy and pleasant occasions reaching & overcoming one after another
                    milestone.
                    Poltu is a completely transformed personality now who ably supported by his wife Basanti is leading
                    &
                    motivating us every day leading from the front. Basanti has been a powerful support in every
                    occasion
                    with her determination, care, calmness and extremely strong mental framework. She has been at the
                    receiving end for more than 5 years when Poltu was suffering from Heart disease and shown a
                    never-give
                    up willingness even when it was told that only option to save Poltu's life is to have Heart
                    Transplantation.
                    It was a long struggle to get Poltu undergo the medical treatment and be prepared for such a
                    critical
                    operation of heart transplantation from June to November 2014. Then it was a period of waiting &
                    praying
                    for a donor heart, which by God's grace was not a long wait. 1st January of each year is celebrated
                    as
                    Kalpataru Day with great joy by devotees of Sri Ramakrishna all over the world because it was on
                    1.1.1886 that the Great Master made public his divinity and blessed all assembled at Cossipore
                    Garden
                    ground, declaring "Tomaader Chaitanya hok" "may you be spiritually illimined". That day he revealed
                    himself as the Kalpataru, the divine wish-fulfilling tree that grants boons to all without any
                    distinction. And on 1st January 2015, we got the best news from the doctors about the potential
                    match of
                    a donor heart. Poltu was hospitalized on 2nd January and was being prepared for the transplantation.
                    Our
                    sincere thanks to the Family of the Noble Donor, who amidst the toughest & sad situation of losing a
                    young life, decided to dedicate his organs for supporting other life.
                    We spent entire night preparing and counting down the time. Finally on 3rd January early morning the
                    Donor Heart reached to BGS Hospital among very high media & TV coverage. Thanks to Bangalore Traffic
                    Police for making it a smooth journey providing signal free green corridor in the road. The
                    operation
                    started at around 10 AM on 3rd January and lasted for almost 4 hours. It was a moment of joy for
                    everyone including the medical staff, doctors and all who contributed to this cause when Poltu was
                    gifted with the Donor Heart successfully under the supervision of team of expert doctors at BGS
                    Global
                    Hospital. This event was highly broadcasted as a successful Organ Donation and Live Transportation
                    of
                    Heart under the guidance of Bangalore traffic police through Green corridor. A series of media
                    coverage
                    since 4th January (links below) reveal that the story of getting second life to Poltu Bera and
                    associated campaign touched people's heart. However, every moment post operation was life
                    threatening
                    and Poltu sailed through all obstacles. There were some major crisis within 2 days, but effort from
                    all
                    concerned proved too strong for any casualty.
                    After going through series of treatment, medication and examinations finally Poltu was released from
                    Hospital on 21st January. He attended a press conference at Taj Vivanta, Bangalore organized by BGS
                    Global Hospital on 20th January. Since then it started another tough challenge for all of us to
                    sustain
                    the expenses & tough challenge Post Heart Transplantation. We kept them in a nearby rented place
                    close
                    enough to the hospital for reasons. We are so proud for Poltu who has shown tremendous courage &
                    character to go through this tough process. Many thanks to Reena Raju and her Foundation “Light a
                    Life”
                    who not only supported with financial help, arranging medicines at a lower cost but also preparing
                    Poltu
                    & his wife physically & mentally to go through this tough journey thoughout their life.
                    We are so fortunate to have Dr. Anand who has been the strongest pillar of support, guidance,
                    treatment
                    and in fact everything for Poltu. We also sincerely convey our thanks & gratitude to not only Dr.
                    Anand,
                    but the entire team of Expert doctors, nurses, medical & non-medical staff members of BGS Global
                    hospital.
                    Last but not the least, our heartfelt thanks and sincere gratitude to all well wishers who directly
                    &
                    indirectly participated, contributed and supported this noble cause pre & post transplantation. We
                    are
                    so grateful to them all over the world whose financial support & contribution made it possible.
                    Poltu was made ready to resume light work by July 2015. The volunteer team led by Partha started the
                    job
                    hunt for both Poltu & Basanti. It was not easy considering Poltu can't take up physically and
                    mentally
                    challenging work, he should not get exposed to any harmful chemical substances, our society treats
                    that
                    Poltu is a patient although he is fit enough, both of them have to work in close vicinity. Going
                    back to
                    village is ruled out as they were needed to be in Bangalore for continued treatment and earning in
                    his
                    village will not be of any sustainable amount.
                    Finally, it was divine bliss that he got a job of security guard in Vivekananda Ashrama (RKM),
                    Ulsoor
                    from mid of July 2015. We shifted them close to the workplace. Today Poltu is spending more than 12
                    hours on his duty - which reflects that he become a normal man with physical and mental strength.
                    Basanti also started working and earning for their own as a cook. Now they are planning to bring
                    their
                    daughter back from Village who is with her grandparents there. Although Poltu is still financially
                    supported & guided, but we are confident that Poltu & his family will be victorious throughout their
                    life.
                    It's only the start of the long journey for Poltu, Basanti & their family and for all of us. We pray
                    for
                    their wellness, prosperity & happiness in their life and of course the support from each one of you
                    will
                    make this happen.
                    Jai Thakur-Maa-Swamiji.

                <h1>Ongoing Campaign:</h1>
                <p>
                    The unpredictability of life baffles each one of us at some point in time. And, when these baffling
                    incidents stare at us like a life threat, things become more complex and hassled. It was life amid
                    hardship for Palash Das, a 28 years old youth, a daily labourer from Panchtubi village, PS Pingla,
                    West Bengal, until he was diagnosed with kidney ailment. Such was the condition that he was advised
                    for dialysis and then kidney transplantation for his survival. This shook his small world miserably.
                    While tears rolled down, anxiety puffed up, friends and family looked for divine intervention to
                    save him.
                    The financial crisis, on the other hand, was a humongous hurdle for him to handle.
                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>PATIENT MEDICAL HISTORY:</h3>
                Palash has had a blockage in the urinary tract since he was 10 years old. Almost 5 years back,
                he underwent small surgery and was advised a Kidney Transplantation in Manipal Hospital, Bangalore.
                But due to their finances, it was postponed with some medication. Last one year, his health
                deteriorated causing severe breathlessness, weakness, and difficulty in passing urine. It is when the doctors
                saw no other option than a kidney transplant to save his life. And his father came forward for the
                same and decided to donate one of his kidneys to save his son. The transplantation will now take
                place in JIPMER, Puducherry. Palash, along with his father will now have to stay in Puducherry, undergo
                dialysis over 12 months before transplantation. There are some tests which will be done aboard.
                After transplantation also he has to be in Puducherry and adhere to strict precautions for
                another 6 months for a better recovery.
                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>APPEAL:</h3>
                According to Swami Vivekananda, man is potentially Divine, so, service to man is indeed
                service
                to God. We earnestly request you to donate for Palash Das and help him fight this crucial
                battle
                of his life. We are furnishing all the possible details about him here below. Please do have
                a
                look, and be a part of this compassionate endeavor, and show your benevolence with any
                little
                help you can. We would appreciate each and every gesture with a prayer for you and your
                family's
                well-being. Needless to say, utilizing this opportunity, we can practice consciously
                unselfish
                work. The donor has more lasting benefit than done.
                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>BACKGROUND OF THE PATIENT:</h3>
                Palash Das has a father and three brothers in his family. They are daily labourers, from
                which they are somehow able to manage their daily life. He was referred through one of
                our
                core members. Back in Bangalore, this situation has deeply motivated our team. Inspired
                by
                Swami Vivekananda's ideal and we decided to put our best effort to support this family
                till
                Palash gets back on his feet again. The amount collected will be transferred in parts
                according to the need of the situation. The approximate budget estimation is around 4.5
                Lakhs INR that includes logistics, investigation, and post-operative expenses.
