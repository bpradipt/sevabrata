        <p>This is a unique and enthusiastic beginning of a promising new born organization. Support from all corners is
            solicited to flourish the idea and see a full grown organization within the next few years. Most of us
            probably experienced the spirit through instances of service on individual level. Sevabrata is a unique
            platform to execute service in an organized manner to implement the philosophy of "Be good and do Good".</p>
        <p> May Swamiji bless us and help us to keep up our constant inspiration, sincerity and hard-work and we also
            need support, love and blessing from all!</p>
        <p> We request you to kindly contribute your offering to support for ongoing campaign in the bank account given
            below, and also shoot an email to the specific id mentioned in contact details section. Heartfelt gratitude
            in advance!!</p>
