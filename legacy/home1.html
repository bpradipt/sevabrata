            <h1>Sevabrata</h1>
            <p>"Sevabrata" - Dedicated to serve others. The name and the motto of the organisation entwined.
                This apolitical and non-profit social organisation is conceived by a few like-minded volunteers,
                who believe in working in the spirit of service as proclaimed by Swami Vivekananda.
            </p>
            <p>Sevabrata aims to extend a helping hand for all those who look for medical guidance
                and all the financial assistance, logistics and psychological support related to it.
                Inspired by the great idea of service to the mankind, members of this group who are
                spread across the globe have already undertaken such initiatives for extremely needy people.
            </p>
            <p>Success of these activities has inspired us to then form an organization, so that
                not a single soul who knocks our door is deprived of basic assistance that they deserve.
                To continue with these noble services in a more organized way.
                "Sevabrata" is a natural manifestation of this inspiration.
            </p>
