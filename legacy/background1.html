        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <!-- Social needs -->
        <h3><u>Social needs</u> </h3>
        <p>We understand that there is a huge need for medical assistance in rural areas of our country. Especially for
            people who are financially strained, getting adequate access to medical facilities is at times difficult, if
            not impossible. The ignorance of the people also adds to their woes.
        </p>
        <p>The key problem areas related to medical ecosystem in our country, particularly in rural areas are:
            <ul>
                <li>There is lack of knowledge and guidance due to ignorance.</li>
                <li>Medical cost is increasing.</li>
                <li>There are always people who cannot afford the expensive medical treatment, especially those who are from rural background.</li>
                <li>Good medical facility and services are uneven in the country. This necessitates patients to move to different cities for better medical care. This requires good guidance and financial support.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>While we understand that we cannot hold every hand in need, but within our possibilities we have pledged to
            reach out to people as much as we can. This selfless endeavour to help people particularly in need of
            medical assistance is driven by the urge to give back to mankind in our own simple ways.</p>
        <p>Sevabrata promises to stand by patients irrespective of their religion, caste and gender. Through various
            campaigns we wish to raise requisite funds for the treatment along with providing them mental and
            psychological assistance, as well. Our team would keep in constant touch with the patient and his/her family
            to give them a ray of hope in their trying times.</p>

        <!-- Activities -->
        <h3><u>Activities</u> </h3>
        <p>As above mentioned, Sevabrata would give an end to end financial assistance to the patient. 
            As an organization, the funds in our reserve would be used. And thereafter, through various campaigns 
            we would raise money as per the requirement. Listed below are our various activities pertaining to the 
            requirements of our patient.

        <!-- Driving Principles -->
        <h3><u>Driving Principles</u> </h3>
        <p>Our driving principles for activities are the followings: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Be good and do Good" and "Be and Make".</li>
                <li>Uphold Swami Vivekananda's ideal, "Service to Man is service to God" and use this opportunity for our inner growth.</li>
                <li>Express the natural inner urge to stand by the unfortunate poor patients, their families and let them feel that they are not alone.</li>
                <li>It is quality rather than quantity, that is the main focus.</li>
                <li>Sevabrata as we see it, is a platform to exercise selfless service and enlightening our own souls as workers.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
