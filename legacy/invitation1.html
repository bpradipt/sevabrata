        <h1>Our Invitation:</h1>
        <p>If our stories and aims inspire you to make a dent in the universe of suffering, then come join us.</p>
        <p>We have come a long way since 2014 when a few of us gathered to serve society fired by Swami Vivekananda's ideals.</p>
        <p>6 years hence, we are still a closely-knit group of volunteers. This time, though, we are spread across the globe with key operations out of Bengaluru.</p>
        <p>Over the years, we have learnt much and amassed significant experience in handling the multi-faceted needs of our patients. What has not dimmed the slightest bit is our aim to make affordable healthcare and rehabilitation a reality for needy individuals.</p>
        <p>Over time, Swamiji's ideals within our hearts have not only grown stronger; it has pushed us farther. Today, we extend an invitation to youâ€”to join us as we embark on a journey to impact more lives.</p>
        <!-- <p>If our stories and aims inspire you to make a dent in the universe of suffering, then come join us.</p> -->
