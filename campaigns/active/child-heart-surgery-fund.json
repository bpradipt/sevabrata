  "fullDescription": "Many children in rural India are born with congenital heart defects that require immediate surgical intervention. Unfortunately, most families cannot afford the high cost of pediatric cardiac surgery.\n\nOur Children's Heart Surgery Fund specifically focuses on helping children under 18 years of age who need heart surgery. We work closely with leading pediatric cardiac centers to ensure the best possible care.\n\nEvery child deserves a chance at a healthy life. Your contribution to this fund directly helps save young lives and gives these children the opportunity to grow up healthy and strong.\n\nSince 2018, this fund has successfully supported over 25 children's heart surgeries with a 98% success rate.",
