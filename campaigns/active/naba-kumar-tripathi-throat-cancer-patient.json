  "fullDescription": "The annual income of Naba Kumar's family is Rs. 36000/-. Two surgeries, prolonged intravenous chemotherapy, and brief radiation therapy (which could not be tolerated) have been completed free of cost. When the patient was finding it difficult to travel repeatedly between Mednipur and Pondicherry, the patient has shifted to treatment from the Department of Oncology/cancer in Mednipur Medical College. In Mednipur, doctors have put him on oral chemotherapy along with a set of other medications to control the side effects. He is also on protein supplements such as proteinex for nutrition since he cannot chew well. While treatment at JIPMER was free, it is not free at Mednipur Medical College and amounts to nearly Rs. 7100/- per month. He is also to soon undergo two scans which include a PET CT scan (cost ranging from Rs. 15K to Rs. 35 K) to monitor the spread of the cancer and the effectiveness of medicines being given. Paying such a large amount in one shot for this scan is seeming impossible for the patient's family. While the school helps in bearing some cost of the education of his daughters, they are still understandably in severe need for funds given their background and annual income. We aim to raise funds for this scan as well as to bear the cost of some months of treatment",
