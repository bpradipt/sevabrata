  "description": "Srimati Guddi Devi, a 37 year old housewife from a rural village in Kashmir, was diagnosed with a heart disease some years ago and was advised of a critical heart operation and related treatment. She underwent a surgery in a private hospital in Jammu. This case was actively taken care of by the volunteers in Sevabrata. The family of Guddi Devi was monetarily and emotionally supported in all possible ways. However, despite all the efforts, Guddi Devi succumbed to some post-operative complications."
