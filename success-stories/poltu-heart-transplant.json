  "description": "In mid-2014, Sevabrata had received a patient from a village in rural Bengal. His name was Poltu Bera. Poltu had been suffering from a critical heart ailment that needed nothing less than heart transplantation. For Sevabrata, it was a daunting task. But with the blessings of the Almighty and unrelenting of our members on the wee hours of 1st Jan 2015, Poltu went through a successful heart transplantation in BGS Global Hospital, Bangalore, under the able guidance of Dr. Anand Subramanium. It gives us immense pleasure to let everyone know that we could arrange a fund of INR 15 lakhs, which also included his rehabilitation and post-operative care. Poltu is doing fine and is currently staying in Bangalore, with his wife and two children."
