  "description": "This is a sad story of Prakash, who at the age of 3 had a fatal brain stroke. Even though he survived, he is left with a damaged heart, which affected his life. Prakash who was 16 years old, used to move around feeling suffocated and unable to do his daily work. His family struggles to take care of him. Prakash could not walk at a stretch more than 15 minutes. Due to this, he stopped study after class 5th standard. Prakash underwent successfully with a heart surgery known as T.O.F. (Tetralogy of Fallot). We could raise INR 2.5 Lakhs. Today patient is completely healthy and started his schooling."
